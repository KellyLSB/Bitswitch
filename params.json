Think of a really long row of lightswitches. I'll help you out a bit.\r\n\r\n![Bit Switch](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/DIP_switch_01_Pengo.jpg \"Bit Switch\")\r\n\r\nBut the general idea in programming is instead of saving multiple boolean values in your database, you can rather store everything in a single integer. Usage could be for security, various settings, etc...\r\n\r\n## Installing BitSwitch\r\n\r\nYou can install BitSwitch with [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/bitswitch).\r\n\r\n`gem install bitswitch` or `gem 'bitswitch'`\r\n\r\n## Documentation for BitSwitch\r\n\r\nDocumentation for BitSwitch is available on the wiki.\r\nhttps://github.com/KellyLSB/Bitswitch/wiki/How-to-use\r\n\r\n## Contributing to BitSwitch\r\n \r\n* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.\r\n* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.\r\n* Fork the project.\r\n* Start a feature/bugfix branch.\r\n* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.\r\n* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.\r\n* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.\r\n\r\n## Todo\r\n\r\n* Think about new stuff to add in.\r\n\r\n## Other Languages\r\n\r\nBitSwitch is also available in [PHP](http://github.com/KellyLSB/Bitswitch-PHP)\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Kelly Becker.
